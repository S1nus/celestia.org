                <p>All blockchains have execution environments, however their functionality may vary based on how they are implemented. For example, the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) is Ethereumâ€™s native execution environment, where Ethereum transactions are executed, and  accounts and smart contracts live. The EVM has also been implemented by other blockchains which allows smart contracts to be written in EVM-based programming languages, such as solidity.
